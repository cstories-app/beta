  Advocates for offshore wind development in Humboldt County say the project is chugging ahead despite federal opposition — including the Department of Transportation withdrawing about $427 million in grant funds to develop the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Terminal.They say with a likely delay of the project as a result, there’s now more time to get it done right. Wednesday, people from a coalition supporting renewable energy in Humboldt County pointed to ongoing work being done to get the project “shovel ready.”One organization, the Peninsula Community Collaborative, has been collecting input from residents of the Samoa Peninsula for years.
