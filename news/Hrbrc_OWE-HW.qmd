  At this week’s meeting of the Humboldt Bay Harbor, Recreation and Conservation District’s Board of Commissioners, the board met with staff and consultants to hear updates on the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Marine Terminal Project — a redevelopment project that will re-envision a significant portion of the Samoa Peninsula as a 180-acre multi-use port to support California’s offshore wind development.Among those items featured on the agenda were an update on the project’s emissions goals, a technical presentation on dredging and material removal associated with the project and an overhaul of the adjacent trail infrastructure and Woodley Island’s fishing and boating facilities to be improved with funding from the project.
