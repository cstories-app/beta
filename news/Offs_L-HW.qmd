Residents of Manila, bisected by State Route 255, are worried about an expected traffic increase. Meanwhile, the Fairhaven neighborhood is facing sea-level rise, and residents are concerned increased vessel traffic will exacerbate the issue.The PPC is meeting with agencies like the California Energy Commission to press for mitigations neighbors want from the planned industrial operation nearby.
